Computers: Extended Reference Text

1. Computer Hardware

Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer
system. This includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM),
storage devices such as SSDs and HDDs, input devices like keyboards and
mice, and output devices such as monitors and printers. Modern hardware
also includes GPUs for graphics processing and specialized accelerators
for AI workloads.

2. Computer Software

Software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do.
System software includes operating systems like Windows, Linux, and
macOS. Application software includes web browsers, word processors,
video editors, and games. Utility software handles system maintenance
tasks.

3. Operating Systems

Operating systems manage hardware resources and provide services to
applications. They control memory management, process scheduling, file
systems, and device drivers. Popular operating systems include Microsoft
Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora.

4. Networking and the Internet

Computer networks enable communication between multiple machines. A
network can be local (LAN) or wide-area (WAN). The internet is a global
network connecting millions of devices. Common networking devices
include routers, switches, and modems. Networking protocols include
TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS.

5. Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting computer systems from attacks.
Threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, and hacking attempts.
Security measures include firewalls, encryption, authentication, and
regular software updates. Ethical hacking and penetration testing help
identify system vulnerabilities.

6. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

AI enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human
intelligence. Machine learning trains models on data to recognize
patterns and make predictions. Deep learning uses neural networks to
power applications such as facial recognition, language translation, and
autonomous vehicles.

7. Databases and Data Management

Databases store and organize data for easy retrieval and manipulation.
Relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL and PostgreSQL
use structured tables, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis
offer flexibility for unstructured data. SQL is the standard language
for interacting with relational databases.

8. Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides on‑demand access to computing resources over
the internet. Services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Major
providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google
Cloud Platform (GCP).

9. Computer Programming

Programming is the process of writing code to instruct a computer.
Popular programming languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and
Go. Programs can be compiled or interpreted depending on the language
design. Developers use version control systems like Git to manage
changes to code.

10. Computer Architecture

Computer architecture describes how computer systems are designed at the
hardware level. Topics include CPU instruction sets, memory hierarchy,
parallel processing, pipelining, and input/output operations. Modern
architectures often use multicore processors and hardware
virtualization.

11. The Future of Computing

Emerging fields include quantum computing, edge computing, and
bio‑inspired computing. Quantum computers aim to solve problems that are
currently impossible for classical machines. Edge computing brings
computation closer to devices, reducing latency for real‑time
applications.
